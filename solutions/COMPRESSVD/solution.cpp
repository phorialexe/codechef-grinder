/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * The operation allows removing a frame if it is equal to its neighbor.
 * This is equivalent to saying that if we have a sequence of identical 
 * consecutive frames (e.g., 2, 2, 2), we can remove all but one of them.
 * 
 * Effectively, we are looking for the number of "blocks" of consecutive 
 * identical elements. For example, in [2, 1, 2, 2], the blocks are [2], [1], [2, 2].
 * We can reduce [2, 2] to a single [2], resulting in [2, 1, 2].
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * Iterate through the array and count how many elements are different from 
 * the element immediately preceding them. The first element is always kept.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N) per test case.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space (if we process input on the fly).
