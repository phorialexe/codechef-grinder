/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has N bottles, each with capacity X.
 * Total water available is K.
 * We want to find the maximum number of bottles that can be filled completely.
 * 
 * 1. The number of bottles that can be filled by the water available is floor(K / X).
 * 2. However, Chef only has N bottles available.
 * 3. Therefore, the number of bottles filled is min(N, floor(K / X)).
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * N, X, K up to 10^5.
 * The result will fit in a standard integer, but using long long is safe practice.
 * Time complexity per test case: O(1).
 * Total time complexity: O(T).
