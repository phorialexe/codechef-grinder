# [Chef On Island (CCISLAND)](https://www.codechef.com/problems/CCISLAND)

- **Difficulty Rating**: 878
- **Solved in**: 1 attempt(s)

## Problem Summary
Chef is stranded on an island with $x$ units of food and $y$ units of water. To survive, he requires $x_r$ units of food and $y_r$ units of water every day. We need to determine if Chef can survive for at least $D$ days given these resources.

## Intuition & Mathematical Observation
To survive for $D$ days, Chef must have enough food and water to cover the total consumption for that duration. 

1. **Food constraint**: The maximum number of days the food will last is given by $\lfloor x / x_r \rfloor$.
2. **Water constraint**: The maximum number of days the water will last is given by $\lfloor y / y_r \rfloor$.
3. **Survival limit**: Chef can only survive as long as he has *both* food and water. Therefore, the total number of days he can survive is the limiting factor of the two: $\min(\lfloor x / x_r \rfloor, \lfloor y / y_r \rfloor)$.

If this calculated value is greater than or equal to $D$, Chef can successfully reach the shore. Otherwise, he cannot.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$ per test case, as the solution involves only basic arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, as we only use a few variables to store the input values.

## Solution Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has x units of food and y units of water.
 * He needs x_r units of food and y_r units of water per day.
 * He needs to survive for D days.
 * 
 * The number of days the food will last is floor(x / x_r).
 * The number of days the water will last is floor(y / y_r).
 * The total number of days he can survive is min(floor(x / x_r), floor(y / y_r)).
 * If this value is >= D, he can reach the shore.

        // Calculate how many days food and water will last
        long long food_days = x / xr;
        long long water_days = y / yr;

        // Chef can survive for the minimum of these two durations
        long long survival_days = min(food_days, water_days);

        // Check if he can survive for at least D days
