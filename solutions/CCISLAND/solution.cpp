/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has x units of food and y units of water.
 * He needs x_r units of food and y_r units of water per day.
 * He needs to survive for D days.
 * 
 * The number of days the food will last is floor(x / x_r).
 * The number of days the water will last is floor(y / y_r).
 * The total number of days he can survive is min(floor(x / x_r), floor(y / y_r)).
 * If this value is >= D, he can reach the shore.
 * 
 * Constraints are small (up to 100), so standard integer arithmetic is sufficient.
 * Time complexity per test case: O(1).
 * Space complexity: O(1).
