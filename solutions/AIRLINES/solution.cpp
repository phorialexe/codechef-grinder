/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has 10 airplanes.
 * Each airplane has a capacity of X.
 * Total capacity = 10 * X.
 * Number of people willing to book = Y.
 * Number of seats actually sold = min(Total capacity, Y).
 * Cost per seat = Z.
 * Total earnings = min(10 * X, Y) * Z.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * X, Y, Z <= 100.
 * Max possible earnings = 10 * 100 * 100 = 100,000.
 * This fits within a standard 32-bit integer, but using long long is safer 
 * and good practice in competitive programming to prevent overflow.
