## Problem Summary
Given a polynomial represented by its coefficients $A_0, A_1, \dots, A_{N-1}$ where $A_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$, determine the degree of the polynomial. The degree is defined as the highest power of $x$ that has a non-zero coefficient.

## Intuition & Mathematical Observation
The degree of a polynomial $P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A_i x^i$ is the largest index $i$ such that $A_i \neq 0$. 

Since the input provides coefficients in increasing order of their powers ($A_0$ for $x^0$, $A_1$ for $x^1$, etc.), we can simply iterate through the array of coefficients. By keeping track of the index $i$ whenever we encounter a non-zero coefficient, the final value stored will naturally be the highest index with a non-zero value. 

*Note: If all coefficients are zero, the degree is technically undefined, but based on the problem constraints, we can assume at least one coefficient is non-zero or the degree is 0.*

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ per test case, where $N$ is the number of coefficients. We perform a single pass through the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ to store the coefficients (or $O(1)$ if we process the input on the fly without storing it in a vector).

## Solution Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x whose coefficient is non-zero.
 * We are given N coefficients A_0, A_1, ..., A_{N-1} corresponding to x^0, x^1, ..., x^{N-1}.
 * We need to find the largest index i such that A_i != 0.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * T <= 100, N <= 1000.
 * An O(N) scan per test case is perfectly efficient.

        // If the current coefficient is non-zero, update the degree.
        // Since we iterate from 0 to N-1, the last index i that satisfies
        // A[i] != 0 will be the highest power.
        if (A[i] != 0) {
            degree = i;
        }
