 * Problem Analysis:
 * We are given two integers X and Y representing the runtime on the old and new systems respectively.
 * A smaller runtime indicates a faster system.
 * - If X < Y, the old system is faster (Old).
 * - If Y < X, the new system is faster (New).
 * - If X == Y, they are equally fast (Same).
 * 
 * Constraints: 1 <= X, Y <= 3000.
 * Time Complexity: O(1) per test case.
 * Space Complexity: O(1).
