# [Airline Restrictions (AIRLINE)](https://www.codechef.com/problems/AIRLINE)

- **Difficulty Rating**: 1042
- **Solved in**: 1 attempt(s)

## Problem Summary
Chef has three bags with weights $A$, $B$, and $C$. To board the flight, Chef must check in two bags and carry one bag in their hand. The airline has two strict rules:
1. The total weight of the two checked-in bags must not exceed $D$.
2. The weight of the bag carried in hand must not exceed $E$.

We need to determine if there is any combination of bags that satisfies both conditions.

## Intuition & Mathematical Observation
Since there are only three bags, there are exactly three possible scenarios for which bag is carried in hand:
1. **Carry bag A**: The checked-in bags are $B$ and $C$. Condition: $(B + C \le D)$ AND $(A \le E)$.
2. **Carry bag B**: The checked-in bags are $A$ and $C$. Condition: $(A + C \le D)$ AND $(B \le E)$.
3. **Carry bag C**: The checked-in bags are $A$ and $B$. Condition: $(A + B \le D)$ AND $(C \le E)$.

If any of these three scenarios evaluate to true, the answer is "YES". If none of them satisfy the conditions, the answer is "NO".

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$ per test case. We perform a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons regardless of the input values.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$. We only use a few integer variables to store the weights and limits.

## Solution Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has 3 bags with weights A, B, and C.
 * She must check-in 2 bags and carry 1 bag.
 * Constraints:
 * 1. Sum of checked-in bags <= D
 * 2. Weight of carried bag <= E
 * 
 * There are 3 possible scenarios for which bag is carried:
 * 1. Carry A: Check-in (B+C) <= D and A <= E
 * 2. Carry B: Check-in (A+C) <= D and B <= E
 * 3. Carry C: Check-in (A+B) <= D and C <= E
 * 
 * If any of these scenarios are true, output YES, otherwise NO.
