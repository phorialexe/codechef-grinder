 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef is happy if the bus is NOT full.
 * The bus is full if the number of students (N) equals the number of seats (M).
 * The bus is not full if the number of students (N) is strictly less than the number of seats (M).
 * Given N <= M, the condition for Chef to be happy is N < M.
 * If N == M, the bus is full, and Chef is not happy.
