/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * We need to calculate A - B and output a result that differs by exactly one digit.
 * Let the correct result be X = A - B.
 * If we change the last digit of X, we must ensure:
 * 1. The number of digits remains the same.
 * 2. The result is positive.
 * 3. The result is not 0 (though the problem implies positive integers).
 * 
 * A simple strategy:
 * Calculate X = A - B.
 * If X % 10 == 9, change the last digit to 8 (X - 1).
 * Otherwise, change the last digit to X + 1.
 * This ensures the number of digits remains the same and we only change one digit.
