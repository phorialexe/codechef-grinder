 * Problem Analysis:
 * Guard 1 counts A entries.
 * Guard 2 counts B entries.
 * Since at least one guard is always awake, the total number of entries 
 * must be at least the maximum of the two counts (because the guard who 
 * was awake saw at least that many).
 * The maximum possible number of entries is the sum of the two counts 
 * (assuming they never saw the same entry, which is possible since they 
 * never sleep at the same time).
 * 
 * Minimum entries = max(A, B)
 * Maximum entries = A + B
